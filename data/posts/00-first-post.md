# First post

Hello, world! Or whatever.

This is just a test blog for now. I'm planning on throwing art and stuff onto
the site, so I guess you can expect that.

This isn't the first time I've done a blog, and it'll probably be relatively
short-lived like the others, but then again, I actually programmed this from
scratch, and it's a kind of interesting setup (serverless/single-page). Here's
the [GitHub repository][repo] if you're curious!

I guess I'll explain.

In the very beginning(tm), I used Scratch to post art. Haha. Scratch was
flawed, though. I wrote a little bit (somewhat indirectly) about that
[here][scratch-flaws]. But really Scratch just wasn't designed to, well,
"professionally" share art.

So for a while I was using Twitter to post art, instead. This wasn't perfect,
either, though. Twitter is nice for sharing random junk like
[this][neck-sizes], but not so much art projects I've put semi-significant
amounts of work into. It's not a very good place for sharing detailed feedback.

What I eventually noticed is that a blog would work best. Just, you know, a
place where I can post updates on the stuff I've made, and at least have the
technical potential for better discussion. So I programmed a blog, because I'm
too lazy to mess around with server hosts and Jekyll and other horrible stuff.
(And also because I wanted to. Obligatory [motivation.][motivation])

Here's a picture, for good measure's sake.
