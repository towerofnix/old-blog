        Huh, you don't have a web browser that's new enough to open this site properly. Or you don't have scripts enabled. In any case, sorry! You can still browse the documents on the site on <a href='https://liam4.github.io/blog/tree/master/data/posts'>GitHub</a>, but you won't be able to comment.

        (Or maybe I broke something <em>really</em> badly. In that case, it's the same deal, but maybe check your browser console and set up an issue on the GitHub repository I linked above if there's an error there.)
